## What is R Markdown?
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. You can embed and evaluate code chunks within these documents. To install R Markdown type the following command in your R shell:
```{r install, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```
Makdown documents have the extension $.Rmd$ and consist of three types of content. 1. Metainformation like title and author, 2. code chunks and 3. text.

## Code Cunks
Start Code Chunk: ``` ```{[engine] [options]} ```

End Code Chunk: ``` ``` ```

Alernatively click on ![](insert.png){width=40px} and choose your desired chunk.

Common Options for Chunks:

* ``` engine ```: Declare the engine to evaluate code chunk (e.g. ```engine='python'```). Engines like ```bash``` and ```sql``` are also available.

* ``` eval ```: If ```FALSE``` code chunk will not be evaluated (e.g. ```eval=FALSE```)

* ``` include ```: If ```FALSE``` code chunk will run but not be included in document

* ``` echo ```: If ```FALSE``` code will not be displayed above the results of the cunk

* ``` results ```: If ```hide``` the codes result will not be desplayed

* ``` message ```: If ```FALSE``` no messages generated by the code will be displayed
